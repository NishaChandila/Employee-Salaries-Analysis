# Employee Salaries in Tech  

## Objective  
The objective of this project is to analyze salary trends in the tech industry by examining the impact of various factors such as company location, company size, job roles, and employee experience levels. This analysis aims to uncover significant patterns and correlations that influence compensation. The insights derived from this study can help both employees and employers better understand the dynamics of salary distribution, inform career decisions, and guide organizational policies for competitive compensation strategies.

## Python Analysis  
I performed data exploration and preprocessing using Python. Libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib facilitated cleaning the data, summarizing key statistics, and visualizing relationships between salary and other variables. This analysis helped in identifying correlations and trends, laying the groundwork for more advanced visual storytelling.

## Power BI Dashboard  
Building on the Python analysis, I created a Power BI dashboard that provides interactive visualizations of salary trends. The dashboard highlights how salaries vary by company size, location, job roles, and experience levels. It allows users to filter and drill down into the data, making it a powerful tool for understanding salary distribution patterns within the tech industry.
